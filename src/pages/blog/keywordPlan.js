                We all want to rank high on search engine pages so customers can find us. The search algorithm that is used is a mystery, 
                but there are several parts of it that are known. One of the first things you should think about when optimizing your 
                site for SEO (search engine optimization) is keywords.

                Let"’"s say you are searching for work boots for women or a new landscaper. You would not search for just shoes or ust landscaping. While planning your 
                keywords, be specific. String together keywords that people would search for like Landscape designer in Washington DC, or women"’"s work boots.

                The more specific your keywords are, the less competition there is on the rankings. This is tricky though. You do not want to get too specific, 
                unless people are searching for that. If you narrow it down too much it just makes it difficult to find, like women’s waterproof steel-toe work boots or 
                female ladscapers specializing in native plants.
